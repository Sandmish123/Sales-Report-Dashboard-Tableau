# Introduction

This project was an opportunity to dive into Tableau and explore its capabilities for data visualization and analysis. Using a dataset comprising sales, returns, and regional information, I created two dashboards to uncover trends, analyze profits, and understand sub-category performance.

# Datasets

The project utilized three datasets:
1. Orders Dataset**: Contains details like order date, ship date, customer details, product information, and sales metrics (Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit).
2. Returns Dataset**: Highlights returned orders based on Order ID.
3. People Dataset**: Maps persons to their respective regions.

# Sample Data Columns:
- **Orders Dataset**: `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`
- **Returns Dataset**: `Order ID`, `Returned`
- **People Dataset**: `Person`, `Region`

# Dashboards

### Dashboard 1: Sales and Profit Analysis

- **Top Chart**: Displays the sales trends across categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology) from 2014 to 2017.
- **Bottom Chart**: Compares profit, quantity, and discount for each category.

# Dashboard 2: Sub-Category Analysis

- **Bar Chart**: Details the profit by sub-category and region, allowing for granular analysis.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes the sales contribution of each sub-category, emphasizing high-performing sub-categories.


# Insights

- **Category-Level Analysis**: Technology consistently outperformed other categories in both sales and profit.
- **Sub-Category-Level Analysis**: Tables and Phones showed significant contributions, while some sub-categories recorded losses in certain regions.
- **Discount Impact**: Analyzed how discounts influenced overall profitability and quantity sold.

# Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with Tableau for creating interactive dashboards.
- Learned to integrate multiple datasets and derive meaningful insights.
- Understood the importance of storytelling in data visualization.
